 * Session/Presentation layer (in OSI terms) handling.
 *
 * An instance of TfwConnection{} structure links each HTTP message
 * to the attributes of a connection the message has come on. Some
 * of those messages may stay longer in Tempesta after they're sent
 * out to their destinations. Requests are kept until a paired
 * response comes. By the time there's need to use the request's
 * connection to send the response on, it may already be destroyed.
 * With that in mind, TfwConnection{} instance is not destroyed
 * along with the connection so that is can be safely dereferenced.
 * It's kept around until refcnt permits freeing of the instance,
 * so it may have longer lifetime than the connection itself.
 *
 * @sk is an intrinsic property of TfwConnection{}.
 * It has exactly the same lifetime as an instance of TfwConnection{}.
 *
 * @peer is major property of TfwConnection{}. An instance of @peer
 * has longer lifetime expectation than a connection. @peer is always
 * valid while it's referenced from an instance of TfwConnection{}.
 * That is supported by a separate reference counter in @peer.
 *
 * @proto	- protocol handler. Base class, must be first;
 * @list	- member in the list of connections with @peer;
 * @msg_queue	- queue of messages to be sent over the connection;
 * @msg_qlock	- lock for accessing @msg_queue;
 * @refcnt	- number of users of the connection structure instance;
 * @tls		- TLS context, if present;
 * @msg		- message that is currently being processed;
 * @peer	- TfwClient or TfwServer handler;
 * @sk		- an appropriate sock handler;
